# Pomodoro Timer Application

## Description
The **Pomodoro Timer** is a simple yet effective productivity tool built using Python's Tkinter library. Inspired by the Pomodoro Technique, this application helps users manage their time effectively by breaking work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This method enhances focus and productivity while preventing burnout.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application has a clean and intuitive UI, designed to minimize distractions and keep users focused on their tasks.
- **Timer Functionality**: Users can easily start a work session, take breaks, and reset the timer with simple button controls.
- **Visual Indicators**: The app displays visual feedback through a ticking timer and checkmarks that represent completed sessions, providing a sense of accomplishment.
- **Customizable Intervals**: By default, the app is set to 25 minutes of work, followed by 5-minute short breaks and a longer 20-minute break after four work sessions. These intervals can be easily adjusted for user preferences.

## How It Works
1. **Start Timer**: Initiate a work session. The timer counts down from 25 minutes, with visual changes indicating the current phase (work, short break, or long break).
2. **Breaks**: After completing a work session, users automatically transition to a break, allowing for rest and recharge.
3. **Reset**: Users can reset the timer at any point to start fresh.
4. **Session Tracking**: The app keeps track of completed work sessions, offering visual feedback with checkmarks.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Tkinter**: Standard GUI toolkit for creating the interface.
- **PhotoImage**: Used for displaying an engaging visual of a tomato, the symbol of the Pomodoro Technique.
